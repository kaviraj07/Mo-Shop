# Mo-Shop

Mo-Shop is an application where supermarkets can buy their products from
wholesalers. The wholesaler part was done by me as part of a group assignment where other team members worked on the supermarket side. This deliverable was for the module Software Modelling and Design from Year 2 of Applied Computing.
